# Mock-shopping-app-HPDF
Mock of an online shopping app done in ReactNative as part of the HPDF program.

## How to get it running
Clone this repository and run npm install. Once npm downloads the dependecies (and this might take a while) run npm start, then either scan the QR code generated or enter the URL shown into the search bar of your Expo app.

Or just install the apk in a fairly new Android device.
